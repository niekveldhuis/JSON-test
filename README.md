 # ORACC-JSON
 
This repository contains [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) that allow you to download JSON-format files from the [Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus](http://oracc.org) and parse those for use in computational projects such as Social Network Analysis or various types of Computational Text Analysis.

The Notebooks were written by Niek Veldhuis, UC Berkeley, and may be freely downloaded, used, altered and distributed.
