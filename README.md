 # JSON-test
 
suggestions to self:
* create object with ijson.item (for instance of members.item.cdl.item.cdl.item.cdl.item.cdl.item) and parse only the nodes in the object (rather than the whole tree).
* create logical get_f flag that is set to True only when ref yields a P/Q/X no. that is in selection list, otherwise False
